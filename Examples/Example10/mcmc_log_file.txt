Warning: The MAP parameter set and mu_AP parameter set differ by more than 10% of prior variance in at least one parameter. This may mean that you need to increase your mcmc_length, increase or decrease your mcmc_relative_step_length, or change what is used for the model response.  There is no general method for knowing the right  value for mcmc_relative_step_length since it depends on the sharpness and smoothness of the response.
