# CheKiPEUQ

CheKiPEUQ stands for "Chemical Kinetics Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification".  The fun name can be pronounced "Check-ee-pook" or "Check-ee-peeoo" or "Check-ee-poo".

As of April 2020, the software can be downloaded and used directly, or used by "python setup.py install" (the setup.py way will install the package appropriately to allow the module to be accessed by python regardless of directory).

The file structure is such that the file `./CheKiPEUQ/__init__.py` is where the modules functions are loaded from. The main functionalities are inside `InverseProblem.py` , and various dependencies can be traced from those two files.

In the relatively near future, the Examples may be separated into a complementary repository, and/or may be tucked away into the installation directory.
